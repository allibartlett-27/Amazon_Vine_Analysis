# Amazon Vine Analysis

### Overview
In this project, I looked at the reviews for Outdoors items sold on Amazon. From these  reviews, I wanted to determine if there was a correlation between the reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program compared to those reviews that were unpaid. I wanted to see if there was any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members. 

### Results 
- There were a total of 39976 reviews, with 107 Vine reviews and 39869 Non-Vine reviews. 
- From those reviews, there were a total of 56 5-Star Reviews from Vine members and 21005 5-Star Reviews from Non-Vine members. 
- The percentage of both Vine reviews and Non-Vine reviews that were 5 star ratings were roughly 50%, Vine Reviews = 52.3% and Non-Vine Reviews = 52.7%.

### Summary
From my analysis, I found that there was no major bias between 5-star reviews given by Amazon Vine members compared to those that were not Amazon Vine members, so the cost associated with sending Vine members incentives may not be worth the investment. As stated in the results, out of all of the total reviews, about 50% of those were 5-star reviews, regardless of vine membership. 

I would be interested to run each star rating to see if the results are just as similar across 1 - 4 stars, or we may see a more substatial difference in negative reviews. Also utilizing NLP to identify brands that were reviewed and see if there was any correlation by brand that received better reviews from Amazon Vine members vs. Non-Vine members.
