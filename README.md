# Amazon Vine Analysis

### Overview
In this project, I looked at the reviews for Outdoors items sold on Amazon. From these  reviews, I wanted to determine if there was a correlation between the reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program compared to those reviews that were unpaid. I wanted to see if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members. 

### Results 
- There were a total of 39976 reviews, with 107 vine reviews and 39869 non-vine reviews. 
- From those reviews, there were a total of 56 5-Star Reviews from vine members and 21005 5-Star Reviews from non-vine members. 
- The percentage of both Vine reviews and Non-Vine reviews that were 5 star ratings were roughly 50%, Vine Reviews = 52.3% and Non Vine Reviews = 52.7%.
